# react-spring-draggable-multi-column
Created with CodeSandbox

I made this because there was a single column drag and drop examples with react-spring,
but no multi-column drag and drop.

It works simple and not literally separate the column.
If you want to separate it clearly, you may want to check react-beautiful-dnd.

Original code is from react-spring official example.
